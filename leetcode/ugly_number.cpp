//     b,2b,3b,4b,5b,....
//     c,2c,3c,4c,5c,....
// like this there are three AP'S we have to find n'th smallest number from these ap elements
// so we merge them(but time limit exiced for this)
// so we thing to optimze more =>binary search
// so we find nth element of min(a,min(b,c)) (that is the limiting value) ans can not be greater than this
